# json-rails-logger

A custom rails logger that outputs JSON instead of raw text. As an extra the
logger also saves the `request_id` for any log message, in the returned JSON
object. The formatter has a couple of changes that are down to preference, but
these don't affect the functionality in any way. This gem can be used with any
Rails app using the installation steps below.

## Installation

In your Rails app, add this to your Gemfile:
```
source "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/epimorphics" do
  gem 'json_rails_logger'
end
```

And this to your environment config:\
`config.logger = JsonRailsLogger::Logger.new(STDOUT)`

## Running the tests

Tests are located in the `./test/` folder.

After cloning the repo, first execute:\
`bundle install`

To run the tests, use:\
`rake test`

or to do both:\

`make test`
